* Hisilicon specific extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile
  Storage Host Controller

Read synopsys-dw-mshc.txt for more details

The Synopsys designware mobile storage host controller is used to interface
a SoC with storage medium such as eMMC or SD/MMC cards. This file documents
differences between the core Synopsys dw mshc controller properties described
by synopsys-dw-mshc.txt and the properties used by the Hisilicon specific
extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile Storage Host Controller.

Required Properties:

* compatible: should be one of the following.
  - "hisilicon,hi3798cv200-dw-mshc": for controllers with hi3798cv200 specific extensions.

Optional Properties:
* clocks: from common clock binding: if ciu-drive and ciu-sample are
  specified in clock-names, should contain handles to these clocks.

* clock-names:Apart from the clock-names described in synopsys-dw-mshc.txt
  two more clocks "ciu-drive" and "ciu-sample" are supported. They are used
  to control the clock phases, "ciu-sample" is required for tuning high-speed modes.

Example:

	/* for Hi3798cv200 */

	/* SoC portion */
	emmc: mmc@9830000 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,hi3798cv200-dw-mshc";
		reg = <0x9830000 0x10000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 35 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&crg HISTB_MMC_CIU_CLK>,
			 <&crg HISTB_MMC_BIU_CLK>,
			 <&crg HISTB_MMC_SAMPLE_CLK>;
		clock-names = "ciu", "biu", "ciu-sample";
	};

	/* Board portion */
	&emmc {
		status = "okay";
		num-slots = <1>;
		fifo-depth = <256>;
		clock-frequency = <200000000>;
		cap-mmc-highspeed;
		mmc-ddr-1_8v;
		mmc-hs200-1_8v;
		non-removable;
		bus-width = <8>;
	};
